# <E-Commerce-Back-End>

## Description

In this application, I have developed the back end of an internet retail company's e-commerce site through the modification of starter code provided by my instructional staff.  Specifically, I have configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. In this application one can successfully open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products or tags. A user can also successfully create, update, and delete data in the database.



## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
In order to run this application, one must enter their MySql credentials into the .env file along with the name of the 
mysql database which can be found in the schema.sql. One must then run and npm i to ensure they install Express, Sequelize, and Mysql2.  Next, a user must source the schema.sql in MySQL.  A user can then run an npm seed to retrieve data for the application. Finally a user can run an npm start and make their way over to Insomnia to test the routes.
